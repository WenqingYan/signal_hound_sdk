- SA_API Version 3.2.1 (8/19/2020)
* The API will detect a recently adjusted SA44/SA124/TG44/TG124 device and update the calibration data on disk when opened.
  Calibration data is located at C:/ProgramData/SignalHound/cal_files

- SA_API Version 3.2.0 (7/21/2020)
* saGetRealTimeFrame parameter list changed.
* Min detector sweeps now available through saGetRealTimeFrame function.

- SA_API Version 3.1.4 (11/6/2019)
* Bug fix: Corrected output frequency when using manual TG controls with external 10MHz reference out enabled.
* Bug fix: Measurement results no longer invalid when standard temperature range SA44B's are in sub 0 degree Celsius ambient temperature environments.

- SA_API Version 3.1.3 (10/1/2018)
* Bug fix: Resolved device disconnection error for certain scalar network sweep configurations.

- SA_API Version 3.1.2 (8/27/2018)
* Updated third party static libraries. (Side effect of increased binary size)

- SA_API Version 3.1.1 (6/21/2018)
* Now only throws a warning when VBW > RBW.

- SA_API Version 3.1.0 (5/8/2018)
* Added alpha frame component to real-time frame acquisitions. Used for persistence decay. 
  saGetRealTimeFrame() function prototype changed to accomodate this change.
* Made the saOpenDeviceBySerial/saCloseDevice functions thread safe.
  This means you should be able to open N devices in N threads safely. Use the 
  saOpenDeviceBySerial over saOpenDevice for this purpose.

- SA_API Version 3.0.22 (3/19/2018)
* Bug fix, querying device voltage for SA124A devices was causing

- SA_API Version 3.0.21 (11/3/2017)
* Low frequency amplitude accuracy fix.

- SA_API Version 3.0.20 (9/27/2017)
* Adds additional 3 seconds of wait time for SA124B start up, to improve startup stability.
* Checks that the SA124B option 2 OCXO is fully warmed up before opening the device.

- SA_API Version 3.0.19 (8/2/2017)
* Resolved issue calling saOpenDevice() with 8 receivers connected to the PC.

- SA_API Version 3.0.18 (2/8/2017)
* Bug fixes
* Added the saGetIQUnpacked() function to aid in non-C programming language bindings.

- SA_API Version 3.0.17 (12/14/2016)
* Fixed issue where low frequency SNA sweeps did not function properly due to high amplitude 0Hz feed through.

- SA_API Version 3.0.16 (11/10/2016)
* Integration for TG timebase adjustments through the Signal Hound Calibration software.

- SA_API Version 3.0.15 (10/24/2016)
* Improved pre-amp response time at maximum sensitivity.

- SA_API Version 3.0.14 (10/11/2016)
* Fixed issues with CW mode for audio streaming.
* Improved filter rolloff for low/high pass audio filters.
* Modified AGC characteristics for SSB/CW audio streaming.

- SA_API Version 3.0.13 (9/2/2016)
* Internal changes to support timebase adjustments made in the Field Calibration Software.

- SA_API Version 3.0.12 (8/26/2016)
* Bug fixes related to audio streaming.
* Bug fixes relating to 200-500kHz spans for SA124B.

- SA_API Version 3.0.11 (6/1/2016)
* Added new saGetIQData() function, provides more flexibility for IQ data streaming.
  See the API manual for more information on this function.

- SA_API Version 3.0.10 (3/2/2016)
* Added saConfigRBWShape() function which allows the selection of RBW filter. 
  The two choices are a 3dB Flattop(default) and 6dB Gaussian filter.

- SA_API Version 3.0.9 (11/9/2015)
* Added functions for configuring the real-time overlap rate and retrieving the probability of intercept in real-time mode.
* Added functions for configuring the TG44/TG124 timebase reference.
* Added functions for configuring the SA124 10MHz timeout out.
* The timebase reference setting will now reset when you close the device through the saCloseDevice function. 

- SA_API Version 3.0.8 (10/26/2015)
* Resolved frequency discrepency issues present at 70MHz center frequency and some low multiples of 70MHz.

- SA_API Version 3.0.7
